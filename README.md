Under the email address admin@comp-econ-soc.org, the Society for Computational Economics has a [Google Workspace account](https://accounts.google.com/Logout?continue=https://accounts.google.com/AccountChooser?continue=https://drive.google.com&Email=admin@comp-econ-soc.org)

Part of that account is a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zaKffdNtbWfJvhwRe1UGeSilmdlzy028) 
on which we should permanently store information and records about the society.

The same email address (admin@comp-econ-soc.org) is also used as the login ID for the society's BitWarden account.

**File Organization System:**
The society maintains identical folder structures in both Google Drive and Gmail labels. Each checklist item includes a storage location tag (â†’ /folder/path/) indicating where related documents and emails should be filed. Use Google Drive for documents/files and Gmail labels for email correspondence about the same topic.

Below is a checklist of things that should be added or have been added.
